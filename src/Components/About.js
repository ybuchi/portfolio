            <h1>Personal Background</h1>
            <p>Hi, I'm Yannik! I was born in Bogot√°, Colombia, lived in Vaud, Switzerland for a few years before moving to New York where I have spent most of my life (currently based in Astoria, Queens).</p>
            <p>Exploring and connecting with new languages and cultures has always been an important part of my life, especially growing up in a Swiss-German household, attending a French school, and living in the diverse state of New York.
               I undoubtedly get my obsession for moutains, snow, skiing, and hiking from my Swiss side. My flamboyance, energy, and love for music can likely be attributed to my Colombian side, and my passion and unrelenting drive come from my American side (I'm a new US citizen!). As such, I particularly thrive in cross-cultural, open-minded environments.
